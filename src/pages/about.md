Hello! My name is Kamal Kishor.

I’m a computer enthusiast with a passion for ethical hacking, programming, coding, web development, and software development. With a strong educational background in computer science, I’ve developed a solid foundation in programming languages, full-stack web development, database management, operating systems, networking, and cybersecurity.

## Educational Background

My journey began in my village, where I completed my primary education, followed by further studies at a government school. I then cleared the JNV entrance test and pursued secondary and senior secondary education at JNV, eventually graduating with a BSc in Computer Science.

I’m currently working as GDS ABPM in the Department of Posts, utilizing my skills to make a positive impact.

## Personal Interests

Apart from my technical skills, I’m also a chess player and enjoy exploring new strategies and tactics. I believe in continuous learning and development, and I’m always eager to adapt and learn new skills as needed. My approach is centered around building a strong foundation in computer science, which enables me to tackle various tasks and projects with confidence.

## Hobbies and Activities

In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, analyzing games, solving chess puzzles, and more. You can view my chess stats on my [Lichess profile](https://lichess.org/@/kadvehcp/). I also dedicate time to learning new programming languages and exploring emerging technologies. I’m passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with others, which inspired me to create this blog. Here, I share my thoughts on various topics, from technology and programming to personal growth and development.
